# draft-2ed

### A way to play an 8-player draft tournament with classic cards
 
- This project is coming along in development
- Pages have been made for:
    1. sign-up
    2. drafting cards
    3. building a deck
- Scripts have been created, but not finished, for:
    1. DOM manipulation for showing cards on drafting page
    2. Client requests
    3. Server responses/actions
- Much more work is needed for:
    1. Game screen (user interaction and automatic rule-based actions, chat communication, etc.)

Note: this project requires hundreds of image files which are currently not included in the repository.

### Known issues:
- Pesky bug with draft data (cards drafted) getting corrupted during opening of packs 2 & 3.  Currently finishing a workaround using programatic duct tape to UN-corrupt the data
